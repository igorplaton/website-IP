WebsiteIP
=========
Browser extension which simply adds the IP of the current website you are viewing to the bottom right.

Fork of [https://github.com/tinybigideas/WebsiteIP](https://github.com/ben8p/chrome-extension-website-IP)

FEATURES
========

Simple solution to always show the current websites IP address instead of clicking through an extension

No load of JQuery so it does not stop the debugger when "Pause on all exeption" is active

Moves left or right on mouse over, it won't get in your way

IPv6 support

No external server to return IP - your browser does all the work locally

Clean, attractive and does the job.

PRIVACY
=======

No-one sees the IP but you.

There is no reliance on an external server to return the IP.

Chrome returns the IP address itself on the users side.

This takes into consideration local DNS and Host changes.
